# Autonomous-Emergency-Braking
This repository presents my work done on Autonomous Emergency Braking in 4 wheeler vehicles which can be customized and retrofitted into any existing vehicle. This I have presented as my college minor project for 7th semester in Birla Vishwakarma Mahavidyalaya College of Engineering, Vidyanagar.
This is a seperate kit from ADAS system which is already existing in cars. I have chosen the most life-saving, safety-critical feature and tried to make it affordable, reliable, fast and accurate and retrofittable into existing car structures with minimal components to avoid over complexity and quick response with minimum components used.
